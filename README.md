TritonHacks: Python Hard openCV image manipulation challenge

## Background

Earth is invaded by aliens; therefore, you (the programmer) have to evacuate earth on a spaceship. The spaceship will have a camera that will take pictures 
once in a while when you are in space. For each image taken, you have to perform a series of tasks to decode the image to see if there is an alien among us.
